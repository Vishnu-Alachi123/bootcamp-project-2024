            My Journey with Hack4Impact: Excitement, Learning, and

            Joining Hack4Impact has been an incredible experience for me. When I
            first became a member, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but I
            knew I wanted to learn, contribute, and grow alongside like-minded
            individuals. The journey kicked off with a bootcamp where I dived
            deep into JavaScript and TypeScript, two languages I had heard so
            much about but hadn’t fully explored. It’s been nothing short of
            exciting to be able to work with these technologies and push myself
            to learn new concepts and improve my coding skills. The bootcamp has
            been an enriching experience, filled with opportunities to
            experiment, research, and build. It’s given me the chance to explore
            various topics, all while having fun. There’s something truly
            engaging about being able to experiment with different approaches to
            solving problems, while also understanding the theory behind the
            code. What excites me most about being part of Hack4Impact is the
            prospect of contributing to real-world projects. Knowing that I’ll
            soon be able to work with a project team, apply what I’ve learned,
            and make an actual impact feels incredibly rewarding. The idea of
            contributing my skills to something meaningful, while also learning
            and collaborating with others, is something I look forward to every
            day. Hack4Impact has not only expanded my technical knowledge, but
            also connected me with a supportive community of developers who
            share the same passion for technology and positive impact. I’m
            grateful to be on this journey and eager to see where it leads!

            As a board member of the South Indian Cultural Club at Cal Poly, I
            recently had the incredible opportunity to help organize and host
            our annual Onam celebration. For those who might not be familiar,
            Onam is a traditional festival celebrated in Kerala, my home state
            in India. It’s a time of joy, togetherness, and, of course, amazing
            food! The event was one of the most memorable experiences I’ve had
            with the club so far. From the moment we started planning, we knew
            we wanted to make it special for everyone who attended, whether they
            were familiar with Onam or experiencing it for the first time. The
            best part? I got to contribute by helping prepare some of the
            delicious traditional dishes that are central to the festival. Onam
            is known for the Onam Sadya, a grand feast that includes a variety
            of vegetarian dishes served on a banana leaf. From avial (a mixed
            vegetable curry with coconut) to sambar, and sweet treats like
            payasam, the food truly represented the rich culinary heritage of
            Kerala. It was such a rewarding experience to see everyone enjoying
            the food, some for the first time and others getting a nostalgic
            taste of home. Aside from the food, what really made the event stand
            out was the vibrant atmosphere. People from different backgrounds
            came together, bonded over a shared love for culture and food, and
            just had fun. It was heartwarming to see new friendships form, with
            people laughing, sharing stories, and enjoying the cultural
            activities we had planned. The traditional games were a huge hit,
            and it was great to see everyone so engaged and spirited. For me,
            the most exciting part of the event was watching everyone’s
            reactions. Whether it was their first bite of a Sadya meal or their
            participation in one of the cultural games, the joy and excitement
            in the room were palpable. Being a part of the event, cooking for
            it, and watching people enjoy both the food and the festivities made
            the day even more special for me. I also got the chance to meet and
            talk to so many new people, building connections that will last
            beyond this one event. Organizing the Onam event reminded me why I
            love being a part of the South Indian Cultural Club. It's not just
            about sharing our culture with others, but also about creating
            moments of togetherness and joy that bring everyone closer. I’m
            already looking forward to the next event, but this Onam celebration
            will always hold a special place in my heart.

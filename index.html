                    My name is <strong>Vishnu Alachi</strong>, and I am currently a second-year <strong>software engineering</strong> major at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. </p>
                <p> I have a strong interest in computer science, though I am still exploring which specific field I want to focus on.
                    What excites me most about the field is the <strong>problem-solving</strong> aspect, as well as the integration of math into solving 
                    complex challenges.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active through sports like <strong>basketball and soccer</strong>. I also love expressing my 
                    creativity through <strong>drawing and building things</strong>, whether it's hands-on projects or working with technology.

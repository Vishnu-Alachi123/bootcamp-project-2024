                                    My name is <strong>Vishnu Alachi</strong>, and I am currently a second-year <strong>software engineering</strong> major at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.

                                    I have a strong interest in computer science, though I am still exploring which specific field I want to focus on. What excites me most about the field is the <strong>problem-solving</strong> aspect, as well as the integration of math into solving complex challenges.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active through sports like <strong>basketball and soccer</strong>. I also love expressing my creativity through <strong>drawing and building things</strong>, whether it's hands-on projects or working with technology.

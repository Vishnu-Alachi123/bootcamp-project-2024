                        <strong>DailyGoal</strong> is a productivity app using  <strong>React Native </strong>tailored for college students. The app helps users track goals, manage tasks, and stay on top of recurring activities or habits such as studying and exercising. It also allows users to set deadlines, plan tasks in advance, and set reminders. The goal is to provide a comprehensive tool for students to enhance their focus and productivity in their daily lives. The project is still <em> in development</em>, but it aims to be a go-to app for task management and personal growth.

                    I've built my website from the ground up using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. This site serves as a digital showcase of my journey in web development, featuring distinct pages including my <Strong>portfolio, resume, and an about me section</Strong>. Each page reflects my skills, experiences, and creative endeavors, offering visitors insight into who I am and what I do.

While the site is complete, it’s just the beginning! I am committed to continually improving it as I learn more about web development, with plans to enhance its functionality and aesthetics by adding new features. Join me as I explore the endless possibilities of the digital world!
